</p>  

Bitcoin is the first generation Blockchain Technology which is the first **Cryptocurrency**.  The native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin Blockchain is also called as **"Bitcoin (BTC)"**. Bitcoin uses CPU based Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. 

## Transaction Life Cycle

## Proof of Work

## Cryptowallet
A Crypto Wallet is a device, physical medium, program or service which stores the public and/or private keys that can be used to track ownership & transactions, receive & send cryptocurrencies within a distributed network like Blockchain. [Click here](https://namchain.blogspot.com/p/crypto-wallets.html) to read more.

## Bitcoin Core 

Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin's Full Node Client. On installing and opening the Bitcoin core, the client tries to sync the complete Blockchain from Genesis Block till the present block to the system. Bitcoin Core can be connected to Mainnet and Testnet.

## Bitcoin Faucet  

Bitcoin Faucet is a service to get Test Bitcoins for development and testing purpose. [Click Here](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/) to get Test Bitcoins.

## Electrum Wallet  

Electrum is a simple Bitcoin wallet from a 3rd party. Electrum like Bitcoin core can connect to Mainnet and Testnet.

## Scripting

Bitcoin Script is a turing incomplete, stack-based language. This is similar to assembly language and so it lacks the functionalities provided by the high-level programming language.
